# Brown fat

Brown fat (brown adipose tissue) is a type of body fat that regulates your body
temperature in cold conditions. Brown fat activates right before you start to shiver.
Brown fat also burns calories and stores energy.

Brown fat is brown because the fat cells are full of mitochondria.

Brown fat in adults is located around the neck, kidneys, adrenal glands,
heart (aorta) and chest (mediastinum).

People who are lean, like athletes, have more brown fat in their bodies than others.

## How do I increase the amount of brown fat cells in my body?

You can take steps to increase the amount of brown fat in your body by:

**Lowering the temperature**: Brown fat activates at colder temperatures,
right before you start shivering. Some studies suggest turning down the thermostat,
taking a cold shower or an ice bath could activate brown fat to help your body
produce more to burn more calories.

Adding **iron** to your diet: You build fat from the foods you eat.
As brown fat is rich in iron, choose iron supplements or food items rich in iron,
like meat and seafood, whole grains, leafy vegetables and beans,
to make sure your body gets enough iron to keep your fat cells healthy.

Eating a well-balanced **diet**: Nutrition is vital for your health, especially if
you want to increase brown fat in your body. Research shows that some foods like
apples and dried fruit contain a chemical that activates brown fat production
called ursolic acid. Eat enough food to satisfy your appetite and avoid
overeating or eating processed foods.

**Exercising**: Staying active is a great way to maintain good health.
Studies suggest that exercise activates your body’s blood hormone irisin,
which tells white fat in your body to burn like brown fat.
This process creates “beige fat.”
