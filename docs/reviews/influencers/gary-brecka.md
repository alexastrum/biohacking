A friend suggested me to take a look at: <https://www.instagram.com/garybrecka>

**TLDR**: Keto-diet based advice. Most of it close to my own experience,
but biased towards one individual, rather than customizable for everyone.
Aggressive product placement and no citations.

The 10xhealthsystem offers overpriced and very limited genetic testing,
also basic [supplements](#supplements). They offered IV vitamin (probably Vit C),
but since discountinued.

They also mention a few overpriced versions of devices that I already use:

- [Red light therapy device](https://amzn.to/493Ilyz)
- [Infrared heater](https://amzn.to/41MkGQJ)

Some nutritional recommendations have YT comments questioning certain ingredients,
like the dextrose sweetener in his stevia desert recipe.
Personal thought: Why not just use natural erythritol instead?
