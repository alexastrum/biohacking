# Blueprint 5000 Study

Great community! Excited to be part of it.

Loads of useful info in the [FAQ doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14zzqrWuLy6yFyoD8HD__ETMrPEs6AfRRHpNunDwZH-Q/edit).

## Radox Health blood panels

Convenient at-home testing packages, privided as part of the
[Blueprint 5000](./bp5000.md) study. $499 package provides better value vs $999 one.

OK pricing, though slightly higher compare with [Function Health](./function-health.md).
If you're having Fuction Health tests, you can skip Randox, since there is an 80%
overlap. The tests missing from Function Health, included in the $499 package:

1. Cystatin C
2. CPK (Creatine phosphokinase)
3. Total IgE (though it offers more elective detailed alergy screening)
4. Vit C serum
5. B12 total serum
6. Folate serum

The tests missing from Function Health, included in the $999 package:

7. Vit E alpha tocopherol serum
8. Apolipoprotein A-1
9. C peptide
10. Urate
11. Amylase
12. Beta Carotene
13. Magnesium rbc (Mg in serum is included in the basic panel)
14. Vitamin A

Doing Function Health panels instead:

- mid-year for baseline â€“ start of February
- end-year post study - sometime end of May.
