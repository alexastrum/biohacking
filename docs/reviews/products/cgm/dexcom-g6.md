# Dexcom G6

Best cost effective CGM on the market,
if you don't mind doing a finicky manual restart of the sensor.

10 day standard wear.

Syncs with Apple Health.

Not available in US / Canada pharmacies anymore.

## Extending life of sensor

+20 more days by restarting it 2 times. Will require calibrarion after each restart.
Further restarts are possibile, but miscalibrations / failures become too frequent.
