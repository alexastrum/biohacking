# Magnus Magnetica Hero PEMF Review

Thank you, Francesca, for allowing me to try your [PEMF device](https://www.magnusmagnetica.com/hero).

## What is PEMF?

PEMF stands for Pulsed Electromagnetic Field. It's a type of therapy that uses
low-frequency electromagnetic fields to improve cellular function. It's been
used for decades to treat a variety of conditions, including chronic pain,
inflammation, and bone healing.

## Observations

After 10+ minutes of use, the area feels warm and seems to respond to the pulsing
through light sensory feedback. I've used it on my broken and partially healed
wrist.

Similar to red light therapy and phisio, it seems to have a positive effect on
the range of motion. The changes seems to be faster and more persisten compared with
classic physio (massage, exercise, and stretching) and red light therapy, especially
when using the most powerful setting (pulse every second) and the most targeted applicator.

## Conclusion

It is worth a try if you have a chronic injury, though it's not a magic bullet and
would probably work best in combination with other therapies and with metabolic
interventions that minimize inflammation and promote blood circulation and healing.
