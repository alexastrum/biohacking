Great, short, actionable book with downloadable PDF.
Use hastag #itsmyyear if sharing on X.

How I'm using this book (1 month sprint):

1. Find an accountability partner.
2. Print the workbook PDF.
3. Listen to **one subsection (with 4 actionable items each) a day** and fill
   in the actionable items for the day:

   1. Check off what's done.
   2. Set an end date for the remaining actions and start now.
   3. Review previous items and check off what's done.

4. When done, celebrate success and take a break before starting the next sprint!
