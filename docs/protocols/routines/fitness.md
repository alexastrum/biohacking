# Fitness routine

Exercise promotes muscles' production of lactate, a metabolic byproduct that
increases the production of BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor),
a crucial player in brain and gut health.

Other lifestyle factors, such as hot baths, sauna use, and meditation, and
dietary components, such as omega-3 fatty acids, zinc, and dietary fiber,
also contribute to BDNF production.

## Morning

Most days, <10 mins.

See [morning routine](morning.md).

## Sun Salutation

Most days, <10 mins.

- Ideally in nature (beach, park, backyard garden).
- Lightly dressed (including in winter and during light rain/snowing).
  Bare feet and/or chest, if logistically appropriate.
- Breathwork

## Gym

1-4 days/week. Keeping them as short as possible,
while focusing on getting close to VOMax.

Any combination of the following:

- <5m warmup
- HIIT: 30s (min) - 2m (max) in zone 5.
  Use a [heart monitor](https://amzn.to/3VJIPWT) to ensure you're in the right zone.

  - <30m HIIT or Tabata lesson on Peton bike.
    Focus on hittinh VOMax

  - <10m resistenance traing circuit on Keiser.
    Focus on hitting 10 reps at 90% power.

  - <20m wall climbing.
    Focus on max vertical speed, until effectively slipping off.

  - <10m Light equipment exercise: jumping rope, pull-ups, battle rope.
    Focus on getting mild musscle exhaution and/or intense breathing.

  - <10m Equipment free: push-ups, jump squats, pistol squats.
    Focus on getting 10-15 reps before being forced to advance to another exercise.

  - <5m Try out anything else that looks interesting.
    Each set should take <1 minutes and hit some kind of exhaustion.

- <5m stretching / cool-down

## Water sports

Most days, if near an appropriate body of water. ~60 days / year ATM. Any of the following:

- <5m Swim
- 10-60m Surfing
- <10m SUP, optionally with Yoga poses

## Barefoot

- I’m bullish on being barefoot whenevr safe.
- Sandals and thin-sole shoes are the next.

## Mechanical vibration

Just like physical exercise, and low frequency mechanical vibration, higher frequency
vibration (low-frequency ultrasound) might improve cell healthspan.

Several [early](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.08.519320v2) [studies](https://www.lifespan.io/news/ultrasound-reverses-senescence-in-cells)
claim to have found impressive way to solve the senescent cell problem:
by rejuvenating them with ultrasound.
