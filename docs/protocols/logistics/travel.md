## SIM cards

### Google Fi

If living in, or traveling to the US, Google Fi is the best option.

It's a virtual network operator, that multiple networks both in the US and abroad.
It supports 5G and Wi-Fi for calls and texts (across many countries).

The USD $65/month Unlimited(-ish, since after 50GB the speed is too low, making
the plan unusable) is the only one that's convenvenient for international travel
and includes unlimited data-only SIMs.

One can pause the plan in 3 months increments, in real time, using the Fi app.
Resuming might take a few minutes, longer if outside the US.
Charges are prorated.
Comes with freebies like Google One and extended YouTube Premium trial.

Supports both SIMs and eSIMs.
I recommended to use eSIM for main line (so you can keep your primary SIM in).
Data-only devices will need a physical SIM (free 1-week delivery to US addresses).

Can be ordered with any **credit** card (debit cards are not accepted) that accepts
a US billing address. eSIM activation is done via the Fi app in a few minutes.

### Keepgo

Great cost-per-GB [data-only SIMs](https://keepgo.refr.cc/alexastrum) for **Europe**,
especially if not using Fi already.

Good backup data plan if using Fi.

To get a good price per GB ($2-3) use a refferal link to sign up.
Apply `GOREFDATA` coupon for your intial refill of 1GB+.

Refill your line with at least $3 once a year, and your balance will never expire.
Some coupons will work only for (initial) refills of 1GB+.

Delete and create a new account instead of refilling if using this as a backup plan,
and you have <1GB left or if your balance expired.
