# Calorie Restriction

Loads of peer-reviewed research has shown that calorie restriction can extend
lifespan in a wide variety of organisms, including yeast, worms, flies, rodents,
and more recently - [hens](https://www.lifespan.io/news/caloric-restriction-extends-reproductive-lifespan-in-hens).

It also has a number of other health benefits, including reducing the risk of
age-related / meatbolic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and heart disease.

Since in its pure form, calorie restriction is not usually pleasant, more preactical
approaches have been developed:

- time-restricted eating - eating within a certain time window each day (eg 11am-7pm)
- intermittent fasting - fasting for a certain number of days each week (eg 5:2)
- fasting-mimicking diet - eating a very low carb and/or protein diet
  for a certain number of days each month eg (5-7 days)
- calorie restriction mimetics - drugs that mimic the effects of calorie restriction
  without the need to actually restrict calories (eg Metformin, Rapamycin, Resveratrol)
- calorie restriction with optimal nutrition - eating a diet that is low in calories
  but high in nutrients, such as the [CRON diet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie_restriction#CRON-diet)
