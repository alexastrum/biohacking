# Longevity

## Food

### Olive Oil

A [Harvard study](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/harvard-study-high-olive-oil-consumption-associated-with-longevity)
showed people consuming olive oil has 19% lower risk of death.

Another [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6352251/)
(ATTICA and MEDIS) revealed that exclusive olive oil consumption was
significantly associated with successful aging, particularly among
individuals aged older than 70 years old.

Additionally, a [long-term clinical study](https://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2018/1/olive-oil-markedly-extends-human-lifespan)
indicated that those who ingested the most olive oil-derived polyphenols
lived 9.5 years longer after the age of 65.

High polyphenols EVOO is 400+ mg/kg.

## Supplements

### Fisetin

Fisetin is a natural ingredient found
in vegetables and fruits, especially in
strawberries.

It has been [shown](https://novoslabs.com/novos-anti-aging-longevity-supplement/fisetin-anti-aging-supplement-longevity/)
to have various anti-aging benefits, including reducing senescent cells,
inflammation, and improving metabolism.

### Nicotinamide Riboside or **Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN)**

NMN (nicotinamide mononucleotide) and NR (nicotinamide riboside) are both precursors
to NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), a vital coenzyme involved in various
cellular processes.

**Nicotinamide Riboside (NR)** is considered a potent anti-aging supplement due to
its role in improving cellular health and longevity. With aging, NAD+ levels decline,
leading to metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunctions.

Various [studies](https://www.healthline.com/health/nmn-nicotinamide-mononucleotide-benefits-side-effects-and-dosage),
[2](https://www.nmn.com/nmn-benefits-side-effects-dosage),
[3](https://healthnews.com/longevity/longevity-supplements/what-are-the-benefits-of-nmn-supplements/)
show that **NMN** has beneficial effects on aging diseases and symptoms.

### Lithium

Very low or microdoses of lithium (in the range of 0.3 milligram to a few milligrams)
can have lifespan effects and protect the brain
[against neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimerâ€™s](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3151375/pdf/394_2011_Article_171.pdf).

### Ca-AKG

Alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) is a substance that naturally occurs in our bodies.

When we get older, the levels of AKG decline. Various studies show that AKG
extends lifespan [
[1](<https://www.cell.com/cellmetabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(20)30417-4>),
[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6044468/),
[3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31242135/),
[4](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24828042/),
[5](http://ukrbiochemjournal.org/2018/11/effects-of-alpha-ketoglutarate-on-lifespan-and-functional-aging-of-drosophila-melanogaster-flies.html),
[6](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/779157v1)
]. In one study, mice that received AKG lived on average 14 percent longer.

### Vitamin C

Vitamin C is important for living longer because it helps important processes in
the body work well.

For example, it is needed for AKG, a substance that has a role in controlling how
genes work as we age.

Vitamin C itself also affects these gene functions, which is important for staying
healthy as we get older [[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.1110#citeas)].

Some studies have shown that vitamin C supplementation can reduce mortality rates
and increase lifespan in model organisms [[2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23643700/)].

Vitamin C can improve the absorption of glycine in the intestine [[3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00803333)].

### Glycine (Collagen)

Glycine is an amino acid that occurs naturally in our body. When we age, glycine
levels decline. Glycine extends lifespan in different species [
[1](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1007633),
[2](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms9332),
[3](https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.25.1_supplement.528.2),
[4](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acel.12953)].

Glycine also reduces inflammation, and has many other beneficial effects, especially
for the cardiovascular system. People with higher glycine levels in the blood had
less risk of a heart attack.

Bryan takes 25g of collagen peptides (comprising about 1/3 of its amino acid content).
