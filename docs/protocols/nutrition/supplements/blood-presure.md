# Preventing high blood pressure

## Cocoa Flavanols

The Kuna Indians, who consume flavanol rich cocoa powder, have been observed to
have low blood pressure and high longevity, suggesting a potential beneficial
association between cocoa flavanols and longevity [1]. Cocoa flavanols have been
shown to [improve cardiovascular health](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027869152100154X)
by reducing the risk of chronic diseases, lowering blood pressure, improving blood
vessel function, increasing nitric oxide levels, reducing "bad" LDL cholesterol,
and decreasing the risk of heart attack and stroke.
