# Biohacking

Hi! I'm Alex.

This repo is a collection of personal notes on biohacking (wellness, longevity, etc).

## Mission

### Personal

Similar to [Jacob Lindberg](./reviews/influencers/jacoblindberg.md),
maximize the area under the curve where x=time and y=health.

More experimental, aligned with [Dave's biohacking laws](./notes/game-changers.md).

Contrast this with (how I understand) [Bryan’s objective of maximizing x](https://protocol.bryanjohnson.com/)
or Peter Attia’s objective of maximizing the area under the curve of your final decade.

### Business

An automated system of **personalized logevity protocols** with automated
validation and correction based on realtime data.

## Principles

- Track data. Make it easy to track. Analyze the data on a pre-determined frequency.
- Be scientific. Actively remove bias.
- Do the basics
  ([sleep](./protocols/routines/sleep.md),
  [fitness](./protocols/routines/fitness.md) and nutrition) right.
- Experiment with everything new that is reversible. Automate.
- Log any actionable items.

## Validation

When resources permit, I use the [adapted evidence pyramid](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3124652/)
in decision making. <https://tripdatabase.com> is a good source of evidence.

When not enough evidence is available, I use a personal
[weak precautionary principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precautionary_principle)
prioritizing interventions whose side effect and risks are minimally life threatening
and generally reversible.

However I explicitly avoid using the strong precautionary principle, have high
tolerance to manageable risks, and prioritize experimentation over gradual improvement.

I have a strong preference for interventions that have been tried out by people:

- Have a solid science-based approach with **citations**
- I know **IRL** (in real life)
- Publish details of their protocols and detailed results
- I can explicitly list several relevant **traits we have in common** with
  (eg. ADHD, genetics, lifestyle, age, analytical thinking)
- Are recommended by **multiple** other people who I believe to be competent
- Present proof of practicing their values and seem seem to hit professed goals
- Having minimal direct financial incentive
