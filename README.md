# Biohacking

Hi! I'm Alex.

This repo is a collection of personal notes on biohacking (wellness, longevity, etc).

## Mission

### Personal

Similar to [Jacob Lindberg](./reviews/influencers/jacoblindberg.md),
maximize the area under the curve where x=time and y=health.

More experimental, aligned with [Dave's biohacking laws](./notes/game-changers.md).

Contrast this with (how I understand) [Bryan’s objective of maximizing x](https://protocol.bryanjohnson.com/) or
Peter Attia’s objective of maximizing the area under the curve of your final decade.

### Business

An automated system of **personalized logevity protocols** with automated validation and correction based on realtime data.

## Principles

- Track data. Make it easy to track. Analyze the data on a pre-determined frequency.
- Be scientific. Actively remove bias.
- Do the basics ([sleep](./protocols/routines/sleep.md), [fitness](./protocols/routines/fitness.md) and nutrition) right.
- Experiment with everything new that is reversible. Automate.
- Log any actionable items.
