# Tools of the Titans by Tim Ferriss

Advanced book. Good listen after going through a protocol for maximizing metabolic performance.

I'm using all 3 versions:

- [Audible](https://amzn.to/3RX78OV) on the go, to familiarize myself with the content.
- A [printed version](https://amzn.to/3RGQC4p) for note taking.
- [PDF](https://archive.org/details/tools-of-titans/) for searching and referecing.

- [Genetic testing](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/genetics) is out of date, but still gives a decent report using 23andMe data.

### Post-workout [sauna](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/sauna-benefits)

- Post-workout (2x30 minutes max temperature) sauna sessions increases [IGF-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin-like_growth_factor_1), plasma volume, and VO2 max.

- Hottub also works.
