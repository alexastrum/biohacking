# Breakfast / Brunch

Usually skip breakfast. If I don't, it is a combination of these:

- Eggs
  - Favourite: lightly fried eggs: something in between sunny side up / omlette, with black pepper, in avocado oil.
  - What is available, if I'm not cooking
- Veggies
- Sides: Avocado, smoked fish, olives, nuts, (high fat non-moldy) cheese
- [Bulletproof tea/coffee](../routines/morning.md)
- Desert: Sugar-free (erythrol) or 90%+ dark chocolate, (optionally) with nuts (excl. peanuts) and/or coconut pulp.
