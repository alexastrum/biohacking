# Fitness routine

Exercise promotes muscles' production of lactate, a metabolic byproduct that increases the production of BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), a crucial player in brain and gut health.

Other lifestyle factors, such as hot baths, sauna use, and meditation, and
dietary components, such as omega-3 fatty acids, zinc, and dietary fiber, also contribute to BDNF production.
