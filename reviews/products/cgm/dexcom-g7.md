# Dexcom G7

Smaller, thinner platinum wire, and better connectivity vs (Abbot Libre 2)[./abbot-libre-2.md],
but 50% more expensive.

10 day wear.

Syncs with Apple Health.

Replaces [G6](./dexcom-g6.md).

## Extending life of sensor

+20 more days by restarting it 2 times. Will require calibrarion after each restart.
Further restarts are possibile, but sensor miscalibrations adn failures become too frequent.
