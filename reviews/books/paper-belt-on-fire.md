# Paper Belt on Fire

[Audible (free with plus)](https://amzn.to/42bazoA)

Great book about the current decadence of the US (and most of the world)
and what historically was the fix for it - raise of new innovative nations.
Unfortunately, the fix is harder now, since no new nations are left to take the lead.

The author lists [Peter Thiel](https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-peter-thiel-svb-facebook-trump-biography-2023-3)
as one of the main influencers (and his employer).

This book is a great philosophical piece, counterweight to the techno-optimism movement.
As a techno-optmistic person, I find the stories in this book refreshing and grounding.
The book has some political bias (towards blockchain; against globalization;
and against class-based societies, like Ivy League).

From a **biohacking perspective**, the book offers a great explanation why mainstream
medicine and diet might be suboptimal for longevity and healthspan.

Actionable items:

- **For (under-)grads**:
  Open invitation to avoid spending time in the established institutionalized education
  system and instead build (great advise, considering the rapid growth of AI/automation,
  decrease in value of diplomas, and the balooning costs of formal education in US/Canada).

- **For everyone**:
  - Stop using time-based valuation of work
    (e.g. hourly wage, diplomas, time on the job) and focus on measurable impact.
  - Look for moonshot ideas/people that solve systemic problems and associate.
