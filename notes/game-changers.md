# Game Changers by Dave Asprey

[Audible](https://amzn.to/48TZ9HW) with workbook PDF for printing.

Personal notes while performing the action items in the book,
adding action items form one Law each day.

How I used this book (2 months sprint):

1. Find an accountability partner.
2. Print the workbook PDF.
3. Listen to **one law a day** and fill in the actionable items for the day:
   1. Check off what's done.
   2. Research linked resources and decide whether they are worth trying.
   3. Set a date range and detailed plan for the selected actions and resources.
   4. Add linked books to a reading list. Many of them are free on Audible.
4. **Weekly review** of previous actions and results. Adjust dates and plans as needed.
5. When done, celebrate success and take a break before starting the next sprint!

## Law 1: Use the Power of No

- Breath using full lung capacity. 4 seconds in, 4 seconds hold, 4 seconds out, 4 seconds hold.
  Repeat a few times.

- Take note mentally every time I notice myself making a decision.
  Was there a way to avoid making this decision by ignoring it, automating it, or asking someone to make it instead?

- Go through your closet and put the favourite and/or most compatible stuff in the front.

## Law 2: Never Discover Who You Are

Action Items

- Find three words that describe your highest, best self and write
  them down where you’ll see them throughout the day. Or do
  what Brendon does and set a phone alert to go off three times a
  day to remind you of these words. Write them down here. Do
  it now. - Word 1: - Word 2: - Word 3:
- Identify your primal inclinations— the things you love that you
  just can’t help learning about. -

- Write down what percentage of your time you spend doing
  things you hate, things you don’t mind, and things that light
  your fire. Write them down here. - Percentage of time spent on things that drain me: - Percentage of time spent on things I don’t mind: - Percentage of time spent on things that give me joy, including
  my primal inclination:
- Now do what it takes to shift your ratio to 0:10:90.

### Law 3: When You Say You’ll Try, You Are Lying

Action Items

- Ask someone at work and someone at home to call you out when
  you use weasel words and to fine you a dollar to put into a jar for
  charity (or the office coffee fund) when you do.
- Set your computer’s autocorrect to automatically capitalize or
  highlight weasel words so you’ll have to change them to more
  truthful words. It’s amazing how frequent reminders drive
  behavior change!

### Law 4: Even Your False Beliefs Are True

Action Items

- Chose one of the methods from this law to figure out which
  of your beliefs about yourself are actually true. Be extra
  suspicious about any belief that suggests you “should” be some
  way or do something, any belief that says you “have to” or “need
  to,” and any belief that paints people or the world in terms of
  good and bad. Write down the first three that come to mind: - Belief 1: - Belief 2: - Belief 3: - Meditate on things you believe to be true about yourself
  and the world around you. Do it either in the morning or at
  night. - Journal about the things you believe to be true for a half
  hour once a week. Start today. - Schedule a recurring monthly or weekly appointment with
  a coach or a therapist who can point out when you believe
  your own story.

- For one week, as you meditate or when you wake up,
  experiment with repeating and focusing on this phrase and
  actually summoning the feeling of gratitude: “I’m grateful that
  there is a conspiracy to make things happen the way they’re
  supposed to. The universe has my back.” You don’t have to
  believe it, but do your best to feel it— you’re tricking your
  nervous system.
- Build the habit of listening. The programming most of us have
  is to think about what we’re going to say next instead of listening
  to what the other person is saying. The story that drives this
  habit is one you learn as a child— that when adults are talking,
  no one will hear you unless you talk right away. The reality
  we live in now is that if you listen and then speak, _everyone_
  will hear you. Choose a friend or colleague who usually has
  something good to say and commit to consciously _not_ planning
  what you’re going to say the next time you chat with them. You’ll
  be surprised by what you learn and what you do end up saying
  when you don’t plan ahead. Who is the person near you most
  worth listening to?

### Law 5: A High IQ Doesn’t Make You

### Intelligent, but Learning Does

Action Items

- Try one of Jim Kwik’s courses (https://kwiklearning.com) or
  another speed- reading course so you can literally learn faster.
- Teach a summary of this book to a friend, colleagues, your
  spouse, or your kids, so you’ll remember it all!
- Improve your fluid intelligence by doing Dual N- Back training. I
  recommend the Dual N- Back app by Mikko Tyrskeranta on the
  iTunes and Android stores.
- Hints:
  - Do it for at least twenty days, but forty is best.
  - Do it at least five days a week, when you’re not tired.
  - You may get stuck for a couple of weeks, but do it anyway.
  - Do not subvocalize (mutter to yourself) when you’re training
    so that you’re only activating the right side of your brain.
  - Push yourself to failure every time— move up a level even
    if you’re only at 70 to 80 percent at an existing level. The
    software I recommend does this for you automatically.
  - Tell a friend or coach you’re going to do Dual N- Back so
    they can make fun of you when you tell them how annoying
    it is. It’s like going to the gym every day for a month—
    accountability helps.

### Law 6: Remember Images, Not Words

Action Items

- The next time you listen to a podcast or an audiobook, _close_
  _your eyes_ and see if you can imagine the pictures that the
  speaker is trying to draw in your head. Closing your eyes puts
  you into an alpha brain state, which is conducive to creativity
  and frees up your visual hardware. (Obviously, do this only
  when you’re not driving or otherwise engaged!)
- Try mind mapping— drawing notes on paper using very few
  words but illustrating the connections between them.
- Consider taking Jim Kwik’s courses on memory at www
  .jimkwik.com.
- Especially if memorizing things is a goal, consider Mattias
  Ribbing’s online courses (including a free training) at
  [http://www.grandmasterofmemory.com.](http://www.grandmasterofmemory.com.)

### Law 7: Smart Drugs Are Here to Stay

Action Items

- Use psychedelic drugs only with intention, supervision, and
  solid legal advice to make sure you’re not breaking the law.
  These are powerful tools, not toys. And do it after age twenty-
  four, after your brain’s prefrontal cortex is fully formed.
- If you’re going to microdose anything— from nicotine to LSD
  or anywhere in between— do your research first and know what
  you’re getting. Start slow. Don’t break the law. And don’t do it for

```
the first time before you go onstage, into a big meeting, or even
behind the wheel of a car.
```

- Consider trying aniracetam or phenylpiracetam, the entry- level,
  very safe, quasi- pharmaceutical smart drugs.
- Consider a plant- based nootropic to see how it makes you
  perform. There is real science behind plant- based compounds
  for cognitive enhancement, but it would take a whole book to
  write about them all. (I recommend Bulletproof’s Smart Mode
  because I formulated it, but there are many.)
- Ask three people you trust to give you honest feedback about
  how you behave when you start using any nootropic— one family
  member, one close friend, and one colleague. Sometimes when
  you get a lot faster all at once, everyone else seems stupidly slow.
  You can act like a jerk or get depressed and not know it. These
  people will be your feedback system. Who will they be? - Family - Friend - Colleague

### Law 8: Get Out of Your Head

Action Items

- Figure out how you’re going to get into an altered state in an
  intense experience. Here is a checklist of things I’ve done. Rank
  the list from what appeals to you most to what appeals least.
  Then research your top pick and schedule it. Or pick something
  else entirely. - Attend a medicine ceremony with hallucinogens. - Attend a Vipassana ten- day silent meditation retreat. - Go on a vision quest in the wilderness. - Finally go to Burning Man. - Try holotropic breathing (see the next law). - Attend an intense, five- day 40 Years of Zen neurofeedback
  retreat (I founded this, so I’m biased). - Consider finding a certified psychedelic- assisted therapist
  who has 180 hours of training from the California Institute
  of Integral Studies (www.ciis.edu) or a traditional shamanic
  practitioner with an authentic training lineage and lots of
  experience if you decide to try plant medicines.

### Most Powerful Drug

Action Items

  therapists offering it in most cities.
- Learn the Ujjayi breath— instructions are at [http://www.bulletproof](http://www.bulletproof)

### Law 10: Fear Is the Mind Killer

Action Items

- Remember that fear requires time, attachments, and
  expectations.
- Work to stay in the moment by eliminating distractions. (Turn
  off alerts on your phone, already!)
- Rephrase expectations to become preferences. Say “I want”
  instead of “I need.”

- Consider doing a nightly practice, such as the one I do with
  my kids. At the end of each day, I ask them to list three things
  they’re grateful for. Then I ask them one thing they failed at
  today. Failure means “something I worked hard on but didn’t
  achieve.” Then, if they failed at something that day, I praise them
  for having worked hard enough to fail. If they had no failures that
  day, I put on a sad face and tell them that I hope tomorrow will
  be a better day, one where they push themselves hard enough
  to fail. If you have kids, try it. If you don’t, try journaling. Write
  down a failure, not just a misfortune, and recognize that it means
  you pushed yourself. Congratulate yourself in the journal for
  taking the risk. It’s amazing how much weight comes off your
  psyche when you do this even a few times.
- Get rejected on purpose! Try a week of rejection therapy— ask
  for things you think you won’t get every single day until you hear
  “no.” You’ll quickly learn that people desperately want to help
  others when given the chance. People are awesome.

### Law 11: Average Is the Enemy

Action Items

- Ban useless critics on social media so they don’t take you off
  your mental game. It takes you only one second to do so, but it
  takes them a lot more time to make up stuff about you. When
  you do the math that way, you always win.
- Before banning them, say a silent “thank-you” first because at
  least they are talking about your work.
- Engage with useful critics both online and offline who
  genuinely question your work, but don’t add personal insults
  to the conversation. They have much to teach you. Be sure to
  thank them, too.
- If criticism gets to you, use the emotional stack on page 83.
  Criticism always touches on either shame or pride. Shame
  hides sadness, which hides anger or pride, which hides fear,
  which hides happiness. So figure out what you’re really afraid
  of, face it, and watch as the criticism loses its power.

### Law 12: Don’t Lead a Horse to Water;

### Make It Thirsty

  happy.

  accountable, and results driven.

Action Items

  your life:
- Write down the top three things that give the most energy to
  your life:

- What percentage of your time do you spend on the things that
  suck energy?
- What percentage of your time do you spend on the things that
  generate energy?
- What are the things that suck your energy and feel like threats
  to your nervous system? Which of these things that suck your
  energy can you simply stop doing?
- What is the easiest thing you can do to convince someone else
  to do one of the energy-suckers that make you weak? Whom will
  you ask to do it?
- Prioritize daily self- care even (or especially) if you spend much
  of your time caring for others. (Yes, this means you, moms.)
  Schedule it the same way you would a dentist appointment or a
  job interview. - How much time every day will you allocate to self- care? - What time of day will you do it?
- Write down a weekly and a monthly recovery task that takes
  more time, and schedule them for the next six months. Open
  your calendar. Do it now. - Weekly recovery task:

- Monthly recovery task:
- Write down your thirty- , sixty- , and ninety- day goals, and then
  weigh all new requests for your time against those goals. Say no
  to anything that isn’t aligned with your goals, or get someone
  else to do it. You’re going to need a journal to do this one.
- When will you write them down?
- Where will you write them down?
- Have you put time on your calendar to write them down?

### Law 14: Miracles Are Possible

### Only in the Morning

Action Items

- Begin a daily practice of doing something meaningful right after
  you wake up. Try journaling, meditating, doing visualizations, or
  writing down goals. Find out what works best for you.
- Put your phone into airplane mode before you go to bed, and
  keep it on airplane mode until you’re done with your morning
  practice.
- When you feel an urge to vent, complain, or think negative
  thoughts, seek forgiveness right away. If you don’t find it, set a
  timer for five minutes and let loose. When the time is up, go
  back to being productive.

### Law 15: Stop Thinking with What’s in Your Pants

Action Items

  findings are apparent in your life. Share the dates with your
  partner, and ask your partner to set up a date.
- If you are a man, see if John’s testosterone comments ring
  true for you. If you are with a woman, ask her when her love
  window starts, and set up a date!
- Chart your sexual activity along with your overall life
  satisfaction to see how your orgasms affect your energy,
  happiness, and productivity.

- If you are a man, boost your testosterone level by having less
  frequent orgasms, doing high- intensity exercise, reducing your
  sugar intake, increasing your intake of healthy fats, and even
  (nicely) retreating from your partner when necessary.

### Law 16: Never Underestimate the

### Power of a Female Orgasm

Action Items

  longer life and a not entirely unpleasant way of achieving those
  goals.

### Law 17: Go Off Script During Fairy- Tale Sex

Action Items

- If (and only if) it appeals to you, try orgasmic meditation,
  BDSM, or anything else safe and consensual that your body
  truly desires to see if it helps you access a flow state.
- Ask yourself what you really want in the bedroom and ask your
  partner for it, even if it’s scary.
- Think about how you can stop making sex routine and introduce
  an element of the unknown to your lovemaking. The result is
  likely to be a more powerful connection with your partner and
  perhaps an otherworldly experience.

### Not Make You a Good Person

Action Items

  when you feel like it for a week or by taking Dr. Breus’s quiz at
  [http://www.thepowerofwhenquiz.com.](http://www.thepowerofwhenquiz.com.)
- Consider red- light LED therapy such as Joovv before bed and in
  the morning— it works!
- Consider using TrueDark glasses or light therapy devices that go
  beyond red.
- Do everything you can to shift your daily schedule so you are
  stacking the deck in your favor and doing things when you are
  biologically primed to do them.
- Make sure you get adequate sunlight during the day, and block
  all artificial light at night to start experiencing dramatically
  better quality, more efficient sleep.
- Don’t eat after dark!

### Law 20: High- Quality Sleep

### Is Better than More Sleep

- Adjust the incline of your bed so that your head is elevated 10 to
  30 degrees.
- Get an awesome mattress (without flame retardants or
  formaldehyde).
- Try sleeping on a thin, hard foam pad for a month (I recommend
  1-inch- thick high- quality neoprene in 80-by-48-inch sheets,
  which cost about $150).
- Experiment with a bite guard that helps position your jaw
  properly.
- Try Night Shift if you believe you are suffering from sleep apnea.

### Law 23: Strong Muscles Make

### Law 25: Make Sure You’re

### Really Hungry for Food

Action Items

- Pay attention to what you eat and drink when you’re
  uncomfortable.
- Try logging what you eat using an app that doesn’t track calories
  (calorie tracking in apps is largely fictional). Rise Up + Recover
  is a good app if you already know you are an emotional eater

```
because it lets you track emotions when you eat. YouAte is an
app that lets you take photos of food so you can look back and
see if you’re actually eating what you tell yourself you are.
```

- Consider following Cynthia Pasquella- Garcia’s program or
  another personal development program that appeals to you.

### Law 26: Don’t Eat like a Caveman,

### Eat like Your Grandma

Action Items

- Don’t eat vegetable oils such as soy, corn, or canola, especially
  in restaurants. Use saturated fat (butter, lard, ghee, coconut oil,
  Brain Octane oil, or MCT oil) instead. Use olive oil on finished
  dishes, not for cooking.
- Adjust your diet if you get hungry within five hours of eating.
- Order a Viome test, the best way to see what your food is doing
  to your gut bacteria: [http://www.viome.com.](http://www.viome.com.)
- Consume more omega-3s and fish oils, but don’t go nuts.
- Get adequate but not excessive protein from healthy animals
  or high- leucine vegetables, about 0.5 grams per pound of body
  weight, or up to 0.8 grams if you are looking to build muscle.
- Eat a lot more herbs, spices, coffee, tea, chocolate, and colored
  veggies to get more polyphenols. Consider a high- quality
  supplement to get even more. (I use Polyphenomenal because I
  created it!)

  products from animals that were fed antibiotics.
- Eat fermented foods that agree with you.

### Law 29: Track It to Hack It

Action Items

- Track your sleep using a sleep tracker such as the Oura ring. Do
  less intense training or fasting on days when you slept like crap
  the night before, and go hard on the days when you’re at full
  power.
- If you don’t have a sleep tracker, use your onboard sensors instead.
  On a sheet of paper rate your sleep on a scale of 1 to 10 when you
  first wake up. Base the score on how good you feel, how stiff you
  are, how anxious you are, and how easy it was to wake up.
- Stop using toys to track the number of steps you take per day or
  fictional “calories burned” metrics. They distract you from the
  useful data you want: heart rate, heart rate variability, temperature,
  and sleep quality. Knowing those will change your life.
- If it’s in your budget, a full panel of health metrics from your
  functional medicine doctor is a great investment. Ask for all
  hormones, full thyroid, inflammation markers, and nutrient
  analysis, plus whatever else your doctor thinks is helpful.
- Have your poop tested by Viome (www.viome.com) to see what
  is going on in your gut.

### Law 30: What Doesn’t Kill

### You Makes You Stronger

Action Items

- Switch to high- intensity interval training (either sprints or heavy
  lifting) followed by high- quality recovery and sleep to see more
  returns on less exercise.
- When your data show that you are stressed, avoid putting
  additional stress on your body.
- When you have exceeded your stress threshold, recover like a
  boss. Consider IV nutrients. Get a massage. Try cryotherapy. Go
  to a sauna. Watch a movie!

### Law 31: Heal like Wolverine,

### Age like Benjamin Button

Action Items

- What are your three most significant accidents or injuries you
  recall right now?
- Do you experience _any_ lingering pain or stiffness or lack of
  mobility in any of those areas? If so, it’s time to get hacking until
  they’re back to full strength.
- If you have chronic pain in a part of the body that’s never been
  injured, it may be the result of an unresolved emotional trauma.

  guidance.

### Law 32: You Can Put a Price Tag on Happiness

Action Items

- If your basic needs are met, stop seeking. Money won’t make
  you happy. What annual income do you actually _need_ to have
  your needs met?^
- What would you do if you made twice that amount tomorrow?
- That’s a good hint about what makes you happy. Start doing
  more of that now!
- If you’ve been lucky enough to secure a nest egg, protect it with
  your life. Get help managing it carefully, and focus on leveraging
  your nonfinancial assets to achieve interest payments in joy, not
  dollars.
- Focus on the journey, not the destination. If you don’t enjoy
  yourself along the way, you won’t be happy when you get there,
  either.

  paying attention until you find some. - - -
- Are you in a community that supports the type of relationship
  you have or are looking for? If not, start with finding your
  community as a strategy for improving— or starting— a world-
  class relationship.

  Bill Harris’s Centerpointe soundtracks, and/or TrueDark
  twilight glasses (disclosure: I helped to start TrueDark and am
  an investor). Do whatever it takes. There is value in unassisted
  meditation, but the tech will help you get it faster.

### Law 42: Allow Your Body to

### Make Its Own Sunscreen

Action Items

- Choose organic foods that have not been exposed to glyphosate.
- Get adequate exposure to the sun— twenty minutes a day

```
without sunscreen and without glasses of any type (glasses block
the sun’s UV rays). Listen to a podcast, go for a walk, make a
call, or meditate during that time so you get a bigger return on
the investment of your time.
```

- Consider supplementing with vitamins D, K2, and A. Be sure
  to get tested first so that you know the appropriate dosage to
  take. Wild salmon and egg yolks are good nutritional sources of
  vitamin D, but they don’t come close to the dose in supplements.
- Spend a week in a sunny place in the middle of the winter if you
  live somewhere with dark winters.
- Consider light therapy if you feel even slightly less energy during
  the winter months.

  locating where in your body you feel intense gratitude. - - -
- Speak in a calming, more soothing voice when you want to turn
  off the fight- or- flight response in yourself or others.

### Law 45: Forgive, but Don’t Be Sorry

Action Items

- Think about the worst thing that has ever happened to you and
  come up with one good thing that came from it:
- What is one limiting story you absolutely believe to be true
  about yourself or the world?
- Can you imagine one thing that would make the story not true,
  at least one time? If the answer is yes, stop believing the story. If
  the answer is no, keep digging or ask a close friend for his or her
  take. Self- limiting stories are never, ever real.
- Make a list of people or things you hold a grudge toward:
  - , ,
    , ,
    , ,
    , ,
- Those grudges are costing you energy, causing you pain, and not
  affecting the other party at all. Find gratitude and seek forgiveness
  for everyone on this list, and watch your limits fall away.
