# Pitch

## Forever Young - A Biohacking Platform

### Why?

- I realized I was aging faster than I thought.
- I got into [biohacking](https://www.forbes.com/health/wellness/biohacking) and
  [longevity research](https://vitalia.city) **to slow down my own aging**.

### Problem

- (I discovered that) existing clinical trials (are too few, slow, and expensive);
- individual experiments (do NOT produce scalable results):

We live in an environment with **decreasing collective [healthspan expectancy](https://alaskapublic.org/2023/03/27/live-free-and-die-the-sad-state-of-u-s-life-expectancy/)**,
even though some individuals have successfully [slowed their own pace of aging](https://rejuvenationolympics.com/).

### Solution

- A platform for **traceability and data collection in vivo** (using continuous biomarker monitors)
- (and a consumer assistant app with) **personalized longevity protocols**.

### Opportunity

- (By combining) **multi-variate testing**
- (with) **real-time data**
- (we get) **continuously optimized consumer protocols**
- (while paving the road for) **next-gen clinical trials**
- (with) **decentralized quantitative research** (data).
